## 📌 Overview

A probabilistic time-series forecasting and propagation-analysis system for predicting cascading airport delays using:

- SARIMA
- GRU / LSTM
- Quantile Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN)
- Granger Causality Analysis

The system models how delays spread across major US hub airports and generates operational downstream alert predictions with calibrated uncertainty intervals.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- Processed **22M+ BTS flight records**
- Forecasted delays across **10 major US hub airports**
- Achieved **23.5% RMSE improvement** over baseline models
- Detected **68 statistically significant propagation pathways**
- Built an hourly alert system achieving **0.760 Macro F1**
- Developed a fully interactive **Streamlit operations dashboard**

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Flight delays create cascading operational disruptions through:

- aircraft rotations
- crew scheduling
- passenger connections
- airport congestion

Traditional systems forecast airports independently.

This project introduces:
- probabilistic uncertainty estimation
- cross-airport propagation modeling
- operational alert systems for downstream disruption prediction

## Project Overview

Flight delays at hub airports do not occur in isolation — they cascade across the network through shared aircraft rotations, crews, and passengers. Current operational systems issue single-point forecasts and treat airports independently, providing no quantification of how wrong those forecasts might be.

This project builds a **probabilistic forecasting pipeline** that:

- Provides **calibrated prediction intervals** via Quantile Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN) trained with Pinball Loss
- Models **cross-airport delay propagation** through Granger causality testing on daily/hourly aggregated delays and physical tail-number aircraft chain analysis
- Delivers an **operational hourly alert system** that fires when a source hub's rolling 3-hour average delay exceeds a configurable threshold, predicting downstream impacts using statistically validated lag windows

The target variable is the **daily mean departure delay (minutes) per airport**, benchmarked against the US BTS standard (≥15 min = delay).

## Research Questions

| # | Question | Finding |
|---|----------|---------|
| **RQ1** | Are ARIMA/LSTM residuals Gaussian? | ❌ Rejected for all 10 airports, all 4 models (Shapiro-Wilk p < 10⁻¹², skewness 1.3–3.7, excess kurtosis 4–22). Log-Normal (shifted) provides best fit (AIC 3600 vs Normal 3793). |
| **RQ2** | Does QRNN achieve PICP ≥ 0.90? | ⚠️ Partially: range 0.717–0.855. Best: PHX 0.855, ORD 0.852. Temperature scaling applied at under-covering airports. |
| **RQ3** | Do hub airports exhibit significant delay propagation? | ✅ Yes — 68/90 Granger pairs significant (75.6%), mean tail-chain carry-over 74.2%, hourly alert system macro F1 = **0.760** (vs 0.364 daily — 2× improvement). |

git clone <repo-url>
cd flight-delay-forecasting
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Data

Obtain the BTS On-Time Performance files (Parquet format) for January 2023 – December 2025 from:

```
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ
```

Fields required: `FL_DATE`, `OP_CARRIER`, `TAIL_NUM`, `ORIGIN`, `DEST`, `CRS_DEP_TIME`, `DEP_TIME`, `DEP_DELAY`, `CANCELLED`, `DIVERTED`, `CARRIER_DELAY`, `WEATHER_DELAY`, `NAS_DELAY`, `SECURITY_DELAY`, `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY`, `CANCELLATION_CODE`

Place all downloaded `.parquet` files in a `data/` directory and update the `DATA_PATH` variable in Cell 2 of the notebook.

---

## Running the Project

### Jupyter Notebook (full analysis)

```bash
jupyter notebook flight_delay.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab flight_delay.ipynb
```

Run cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook is designed to be fully reproducible with `SEED = 42`.

> **Estimated runtime:** ~45–90 minutes on CPU (GRU/LSTM/QRNN training). GPU significantly reduces deep learning stages.

### Streamlit Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dash.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501`. The dashboard uses pre-computed metrics from the notebook and generates synthetic demo time-series for visualization — no live data connection is required.

## Dashboard Guide

![Map](dashboard/dash1.png)
![Map](dashboard/dash2.png)


The Streamlit dashboard (`dash.py`) has 8 pages:

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📊 Overview | Pipeline summary, key KPIs, PHX RMSE chart |
| 🚨 Ops Center | Live propagation risk map, active alerts, recommended actions |
| 🛬 Airport Explorer | Per-airport forecast chart, QRNN reliability diagram, model comparison |
| 📈 Model Comparison | PHX focus, master table (all airports), ARIMA vs GRU vs QRNN |
| 🔬 Noise Analysis | Residual distributions, normality tests, log-likelihood comparison |
| 🌐 Propagation | Granger causality heatmap, tail-number chains, top propagation pairs |
| 🕐 Hourly Alert System | Per-pair Precision/Recall/F1, daily vs hourly improvement |
| ❓ RQ Answers | Definitive answers to RQ1, RQ2, RQ3 with supporting charts |

**Ops Center alert mechanics:**
- Source signal: rolling 3-hour average of hourly mean departure delay
- Alert fires when source signal > configurable threshold (default: 15 min)
- Target window: Granger lag × 24h ± 6h slack
- Only 68 Granger-significant pairs (p < 0.05) are used

---

## Reproducibility

All random seeds are fixed globally:

```python
SEED = 42
import random, numpy as np, torch
random.seed(SEED)
np.random.seed(SEED)
torch.manual_seed(SEED)
os.environ["PYTHONHASHSEED"] = str(SEED)
```

Train/test split is **chronological** (no shuffling, no data leakage). All lags use `.shift(1)` to prevent look-ahead bias. Rolling statistics use `.shift(1).rolling(window)`.

---

## Dependencies

- **Data:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `pyarrow`
- **Statistics:** `statsmodels`, `pmdarima`, `scipy`
- **Deep Learning:** `torch`, `scikit-learn`
